Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

For this project, I created a calculator in which all of the logic and operations are done server-side and then sent back to the client and displayed on the DOM.

Creating a functioning calculator is not difficult, but creating one that does all of the operations in the server was a challenge for me.
